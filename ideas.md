# Market based resource allocation.

* Use energy as currency or 'local' currency, pegged or initially pegged to 1 coin = 1 energy.


## Auctioning
creep spawning, building construction and transport are limited resources/services that need to be allocated.
Creep spawning and building construction needs both reources (energy) and production capacity (a spawn or worker creeps), we can either

A) auction off production capacity and energy separately.
B) auction off spawned creature / produced building separately.

Not every entity will want the same type of creep spawned, so the item being auctioned off has to be defined in terms of energy cost/time to spawn.
